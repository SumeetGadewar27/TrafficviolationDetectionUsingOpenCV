# Traffic Violation Detection Using OpenCV
An automatic traffic red-light violation detection system implemented, which may play a big role in transportation management in smart cities. The system mainly relies on modern computer vision techniques, which were implemented in OpenCV under a Python environment. Mainly, the system consists of an object detector and object tracker which work in an integrated manner to precisely keep the position of the existing cars. The primary task of the system is to eventually indicate locations of violating vehicles. The output showed accurate results, as all violating vehicles were detected and distinguished precisely.
Partially Running code, 1st model is Running fine. 
The Masking Part is running with  85% accuracy. The Cascade Model is still in the testing mode, need some suggestion. We trying hard to get the Accuracy in the cascade model.
